# CSC354-Mini SIC/XE Assemble, linker, and loader
A simple SIC/XE assembler, linker, and loader implemented in C++.



Run the program with clang 7 or higher to compile all the files, then type 

    ./main test1.o test2.o

to link two test files together and the program will output the linked output.


You can also link more than  2 files together. You can try any number of object files and see what the output is.
